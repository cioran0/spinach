This is a firefox extension for android to change the color of text to green
and background to white for easier reading in order to enhance accessibility for some users

- I have added specific workarounds for reddit, youtube, zillow, and google images
- fixed transparency issues on multiple menus
- added ID, which was deemed necessary during linting for firefox (gecko) and firefox android (gecko_android)
- Signed by mozilla on AMO at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/spinach/
