This is a firefox extension for android to change the color of text to green
and background to white for easier reading in order to enhance accessibility for some users

- I have added specific workarounds for reddit, youtube, zillow, and google images
- fixed transparency issues on multiple menus
- added ID, which was deemed necessary during linting for firefox (gecko) and firefox android (gecko_android)
- Some problems with transparency of background w/hidden child <ul> with hidden <li>'s children esp when <a>
-- Must be fixed on site by site basis
